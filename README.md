# üìÑ Application Risk Analysis Report

**App Name:** MEGAKAYA777  
**Package:** `com.megakaya777png.h5wrap`  
**Version:** 1.3.0  
**Assessment Date:** April 22, 2025  
**Conducted By:** Vernon.L

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Executive Summary

The MEGAKAYA777 gambling application requests multiple high-risk Android permissions that are not clearly justifiable based on its core functionality. Several of these permissions expose users to potential data privacy breaches. Additionally, the app exhibits weak cryptographic implementations and integrates with various third-party services that may collect sensitive information.

---

## üîç Permission Usage and Risk Assessment

### 1. Camera Access

**Purpose Identified:**
- Likely used for KYC (Know Your Customer) verification ‚Äî capturing ID documents and user selfies.
- May support live video chat with agents or casino dealers.

**Security Consideration:**
- Access to the camera can be misused to capture images or video without user consent.
- Must be paired with clear user awareness and consent mechanisms.

---

### 2. Storage Access (Read/Write External Storage)

**Purpose Identified:**
- Caching game resources, saving transaction receipts or promotional material.

**Security Risk:**
- External storage is globally accessible by other apps, raising the risk of unauthorized data access.
- Potential for leaking sensitive user information like financial records or screenshots.

---

### 3. Read Contacts

**Purpose Identified:**
- Possibly for social features like referring friends.

**Security Risk:**
- This permission is highly intrusive. It allows full access to the user's contact list, which may be leveraged for marketing, data mining, or sold to third parties.
- There is no obvious in-app functionality that necessitates this level of access.

---

### 4. Notifications & Push Services

**Purpose Identified:**
- Used for sending promotional alerts, bet reminders, win notifications.
- Integration with Firebase and Huawei services for push functionality.

**Security Consideration:**
- While not inherently dangerous, excessive or manipulative notifications may constitute a dark pattern to encourage continued gambling behavior.

---

### 5. Anti-VM & Emulator Checks

**Purpose Identified:**
- Designed to detect execution within virtual environments, commonly used by testers, researchers, or fraudsters.

**Security Consideration:**
- Anti-analysis behavior is typically found in apps attempting to evade reverse engineering or dynamic analysis.
- May be indicative of attempts to hide suspicious or malicious behavior.

---

### 6. Insecure Cryptography & Data Handling

**Findings:**
- Usage of weak hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-1).
- Vulnerable encryption configurations (e.g., CBC mode with PKCS padding).
- Evidence of logging sensitive information in plaintext.
- Use of temp files for storing potentially sensitive data.

**Security Risk:**
- High. These weaknesses could allow attackers to intercept or manipulate data, or extract credentials during reverse engineering.

---

### 7. Third-Party Tracking and Analytics

**Findings:**
- Integrations with Microsoft AppCenter, Huawei services, Firebase, and others.
- Data likely collected: device info, usage analytics, error/crash logs.

**Security Risk:**
- Potential for unauthorized data profiling or tracking across devices.
- Data sharing practices must comply with GDPR and other data privacy regulations.

---

## üßæ Final Assessment: Likely Malicious Application

Based on its behavior, permission requests, and anti-analysis mechanisms, the MEGAKAYA777 app appears to be intentionally designed to:

- **Harvest sensitive user data** (contacts, file contents, usage patterns)
- **Bypass analysis and detection** via anti-VM/emulator checks
- **Abuse user trust** through covert surveillance-like permissions (e.g., camera and external storage access)

There is **no clear legitimate justification** for a gambling app to request such intrusive access or implement advanced obfuscation and device fingerprinting techniques unless it intends to:

- Monitor users
- Steal data
- Operate as spyware

---

## üö´ Recommendation

**Do not use or install this application.** It should be considered **high-risk or outright malicious**. The application must be reported to relevant security vendors and platform stores for takedown and blacklisting.
