# ⚠️ Summary: Why Would a Gambling App Need These Permissions?

---

## 1. Camera Access
**Could be used for:**
- KYC (Know Your Customer) verification — taking pictures of ID documents or user selfies.
- Live chat/video support with agents or dealers (in some live casino variants).

---

## 2. Storage Access (Read/Write External Storage)
**Used to:**
- Save cached game data or downloaded assets.
- Store receipts or screenshots of transactions.
- Share promotional content (like banners or referral links).

⚠️ **Risk:** If abused, it could allow access to personal files or photos.

---

## 3. Read Contacts
- Possibly for referral features — invite friends.
- May be misused for data mining or unauthorized marketing.

⚠️ **Risk:** Highly invasive and generally not justifiable for gambling purposes.

---

## 4. Notifications & Push Services
- Used to send promo messages, betting reminders, and win notifications.
- Firebase and Huawei push services are heavily integrated.

---

## 5. Anti-VM & Emulator Checks
- To block users from running the app in virtual environments, often used by developers, testers, or fraudsters.

---

## 6. Insecure Cryptography & Data Handling
- The app uses deprecated encryption methods (like SHA-1, CBC padding).
- Sensitive data is stored in logs and temp files, which are **serious red flags**.

---

## 7. Third-Party Tracking & Analytics
- Integrations with Microsoft AppCenter and Huawei services.
- Collect usage data and crash logs, possibly tracking user behavior extensively.
